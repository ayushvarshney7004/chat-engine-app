# chat-engine-app
build on react.js , vite.js and chat gpt-3.4 api , is an interactive app , used for to learn the fundamentals of messaging and requesting communication , the help and reference is taken from youtube videos and the react course itself form udemy 
the other technologies are used in this project our Sass , and GPT-3.5 API's 
the whole purpose to build this app is to learn new things about react.js , while implementing and improvising already learned concept from it 
in detail this app also have authentication services which are being created by using redux store.
routing is also been used to create the home page and chat domain for the users .
# the current lack of this app
  1. the app is only static site i.e it is not on internet to be used by different clients
  2. more styling and interactive features can be added to the app , for now which are not the part of this app.
  3. the chat engine used in the bottom floor of this app is only restricted to be used for 30 days, so again have to create a new-server to perform 
  4. GPT-3.5 which , i am using this app is certainly limit to many resources , it might perform unrequired operations or give answers which are not requested.
# the current achievement 
  1. this app helps me to understand more under the hood working of react , and react-router-dom , http request and response.
  2. this app uses vite.js because it is faster for the server side to load or render all the pages faster than usual react.js script.
  3. using gpt is quite of an experience as i learned how to play with it , and tweek some responses recieved by it , to modify app more.
